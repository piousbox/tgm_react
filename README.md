## Develop

20170517: I tried peact-google-maps, now trying google-maps-react

## Test

 npm run test-travis

## Install

dev port 8005 (conflicts with tomcat7 by default, so `sudo service tomcat7 stop`)

to setup tgm:

 git clone <your repo>
 npm install
 npm run build
 npm run start
 npm run test

look at package.json scripts to see the definition of each script. To run a script, do `npm run <script name>`

The environment definitions are in config/ folder, feel free to create your own. "development" environment is the local environment that can be overwritten. You can create your own "development_<username>" environment and expect it to never be overwritten by other users.

in ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile:

 alias be='bundle exec '

You have to have local API running at localhost:3000, so do:

 cd <M3_ROOT> && be rails s
